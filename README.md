# ISAT252Decay
A project for ISAT 252 about radioactive decay. Coded in Python


Team Members:

When running the code, Have the value for your total weight for the material and Isotope that you are simulating in kg
Also have the % weight of the total weight that is made up by the Isotope
Finally have the radioactivity in kBq of the Isotope.

The program has two options, a manual and an automatic simulation.

Manual:
For manual simulation, the program will ask you to press "enter" to simulate a day of decay for the isotope. Every
decay value will be displayed per day until it reaches its safe level.

Automatic:
The decay will automatically simulate over multiple days until it reaches safe level while also plotting the decay on
a graph for you too see.
